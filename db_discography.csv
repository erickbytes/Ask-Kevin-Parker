7,Half Full Glass of Wine,"Said you wouldn't be home late tonight
I gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
It's been so long since I held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be
I thank god I've been blessed with a patient mind
Because what I want to happen won't happen in a very long time
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine
It's been so long since I held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be",Innerspeaker
8,Desire Be Desire Go,"Feel it come, I don't know how long
It's gonna stay with me, I'll let desire be, desire go
Oh, dare I face the real world
Everyday, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, everyday
Everyday, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I'll get out, won't have to check my watch
I don't have the verve to belong to this dead side
Why I ever tried, I don't know
Oh, dare I face the real world
Everyday, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, everyday
Everyday, back and forth, what's it for?

9,Mind Mischief,"Feels like my life is ready to blow,
Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long,
I just don't know where the hell I belong
How optimism led me astray,
Two hundred things I took the wrong way
But I saw her love gauge running low,
I tried to fill but it overflowed
Feels like my life is ready to blow,
Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long,
I just don't know where the hell I belong
She remembers my name
Could be blown way out, way out
It's all going to change
She remembers my name
But she was only messing around,
Please, no more playing with my heart
Ooh, go with Mr. Right just for once
Ooh, no more mischief with my mind
Then it all just came out
Guess I'll hold it in next time",Lonerism
10,It Is Not Meant To Be,"I wanted her I wanted her
But she doesn't like the life that I lead
She doesn't like the life that I lead
Doesn't like sand stuck on her feet
Or sitting around smoking weed
I must seem more like a friend in need

And I boast that it is meant to be
But in all honesty I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move
And in all honesty I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move

And she doesn't like the friends that I make
Doesn't make friends for friendship's sake
She just gets bored sitting by the lake
Her soul won't surface and her heart won't ache

And I boast that it is meant to be
But in all honesty I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move

And I thought they could cure his disease
But in all honesty he didn't have a hope in hell
Now we'll never see him move",Innerspeaker
11,Alter Ego,"Said the voice from afar, don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard?
Waiting for everyone else around to agree
Might take too long, might take too long
When it won't be so hard (it won't be so hard)
Well it's true, yes but you won't get far telling me

That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do, oh alter ego

Get them to love you while they may depending on your words and wealth
The only one who's really judging you is yourself
Nobody else, nobody else
If I could part it wouldn't be so hard (it wouldn't be so hard)
Well it's true, yes but you won't get far telling me

That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do, oh alter ego",Innerspeaker
12,Lucidity,"I know where you went but I don't know how you got there
I know where you went but I don't know how you got there
Silver tongue hill where you talk up what I'd play down
I would speak up but I wouldn't know what to say
Lucidity, come back to me
Put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
Oh, it's hard to tell, it breaks down
There is a will, there is a way
Wondering around like spare time never knew it
I might suck fizzle or I might just float away
And we'll go running off tonight
High above, where we won't even need to reach the sky
My love, oh, there will be a change in the air
Nobody will be anybody else
Lucidity, come back to me
Put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
Oh, where we'll go, tiptoe
Tread boldly right down to the lair",Innerspeaker
13,Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind?,"Why won't you make up your mind? Give me a sign!
Why won't you make up your mind? Give me a sign!
Am I wasting my time living in my head?
You'll be sorry when I make up mine instead

14,Solitude is Bliss,"Cracks in the pavement underneath my shoe
I care less and less about and less about you
No one else around to look at me
So I can look at my shadow as much as I please

All the kicks that I can't compare to
Making friends like they're all supposed to

You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel 

Space around me where my soul can breathe
I've got body that my mind can leave
Nothing else matters, I don't care what I miss
Company's okay
Solitude is bliss

There's a party in my head and no one is invited

And you will never come close to how I feel 
And you will never come close to how I feel 

Movement doesn't flow
Quite like it does when I'm alone
I'll be the one who's free
You and all your friends
Can watch me, today

Don't ask me how you're supposed to feel

You will never come close to how I feel 
You will never come close to how I feel 
You will never come close to how I feel 
You will never come close to how I feel",Innerspeaker
15,Expectation,"Everything you ever told me could have been a lie
We may never have been in love
Stuck on thinking that there is always something to lose
Or a hit from above, a hit from above
I don't need what I'm holding on to, I wish I knew but meanwhile

Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking it's toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
'Cause everything you ever told me could have been a lie
We may never have been in love

And then I will escape, I'll never ever have to see
Another disappointed face, no one to please
Every now and then, it feels like, in all of the universe 
There is nobody for me
I told myself I wouldn't care, no I wouldn't care
But when she said she'd come 'round
I combed my hair, yes I checked my hair
Oh, meanwhile, meanwhile, meanwhile

Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking it's toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking it's toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking it's toll
Fluctuations is making me feel old
Expectation is taking it's toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul...",Innerspeaker
16,The Bold Arrow of Time,"Overhead ether flow, moment, colors run
Time so slow, slow
I've never seen the arrow of time fly
So low
And time flows on",Innerspeaker
17,Runway Houses City Clouds,"But don't remind me of home, there's everywhere I'd rather go
It's true that some things have to change
And don't remind me of home or I might notice where I am
It's true that some things have to change
I know some things have to change
It's true that some things have to change
I know some things have to change
And gazing out the window as I ascend into the sky
But I'm the one who's left behind
I'm the one who's left behind
There is nothing that is safe
I know some things have to change
Yeah, I do, yeah, I do
But don't remind me of home, incase it isn't quite the same",Innerspeaker
18,I Don't Really Mind,"Shifting, shifting, shifting aloud like it makes so much difference to me
Huffing, puffing, marching around like I know how much better it should be
I know it looks like I disagree, nine tenths of the time

But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind

Childhood puppy is old and gruff, your mother wants to give him away
Pillar of strength was lifted off his deathbed, 3 weeks ago today

But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind

But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind

19,Be Above It,"Gotta be above it
Gotta be above it

And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I know that I can't let them bring me down
And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
And I know that I gotta be above it now

And I know that I gotta be above it now

And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I cannot let them all just bring me down

This time I'm just gonna take it all
I'm never gonna shake it up
I'll just close my eyes and make so that all the things don't affect me now
I know that I gotta be above it now

And I cannot let them all just bring me down

This time I'm just gonna take or I'm never gonna shake it

Gotta be above it
Gotta be above it",Lonerism
20,Endors Toi,"Soothing repeat,
I look down at my feet,
It's a hypnotist's arm,
And it works like a charm.
But I won't be deprived,
Real worlds, surreal life,
Do or die,
There is time,
Go to sleep,
You'll be fine.
In the morning you'll find,
Real life was such a grind.
Off I go, day is done
Where a new one's just begun.",Lonerism
21,Apocalypse Dreams,"This could be the day that we push through
It could be the day that all our dreams come true
For me and you
'Til we're at the end of just another day

Are you too terrified to try your best?
Just to end up with an educated guess
Like success
Like those times you wake up mystified

Oh it feels so real in my sleep
Never felt so good, so close I do with you
Into the day, the strangest feeling
Do you really live without the fear?

Everything is changing
And there's nothing I can do
My world is turning pages
While I am just sitting here

Well, am I getting closer?
Will I ever get there?
Does it even matter?
Do I really need it?
Wish that I'd remember
And I'm on the outcome

Push it out the window
On and on we all go
Into another morning
It was only yesterday
Didn't even know you
Now I'm gonna miss you

Nothing ever changes
No matter how long you do your hair
Looks the same to everyone else
Everything is changing
I guess I should warn my mum
But she'll just be excited",Lonerism
22,Music To Walk Home By,"But that's only when I think of you
Some vision that I hold on to
You know it's everything I do
You know it's everything I do

Can almost stand competing with the others
Can almost hear the fun that I should be having
Instead of all this dreaming

But it's only when I think of you
The mover I could turn into
There must be something I can do
There must be something I can do

But I just don't know
How to feel right
A beautiful girl
Is wasting my life
I'm playing a part
As somebody else
While trying so hard
To be myself
I just need to hear
Somebody say
That this will make sense one day
I guess I'm alright
But they're all doing so well
What I would give
To be under that spell

You'll know soon, you'll know soon
You'll know soon, you'll know soon
You'll know soon, you'll know soon, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah

In so many ways
I'm somebody else
I'm trying so hard
To be myself
I just need to hear
Somebody say
That this will all make
Sense one day

Well it's getting late
I'd better go
I made it this far
As far as I know",Lonerism
23,Why Won't They Talk To Me?,"Out of the zone
Trying to see
I'm so alone
Nothing for me

Try to be sane
Try to pretend
None of it happened
Oh this old tree
Lonely old me
Whoops-a-daisy
I thought I was happy

Out of the zone
Now that I see
I don't need them

24,Feels Like We Only Go Backwards,"It feels like I only go backwards baby,
Every part of me says go ahead,
I've got my hopes up again, oh no, not again.
It feels like we only go backwards, darlin'

I know that you think you've set sail when you call my name
But I get it inside my head all day
When I realize I'm just hopin' onto the hope that
Maybe, your feelings don't show

25,Keep On Lying,"All I give are little clues
Maybe one day I'll get through

I'll just keep on lying to you

I only need to say its true
Your poor little heart already knew
But there is nothing you can do
I'll just keep on lying to you

Should my cover ever blow
Would you ever let it go?
There is something you should know
But hell if I'd ever let it show

So here I am, trying to be strong
It was noon, now my shadow's long
I guess I'll go and tell you just as soon as I get to the end of this song
To the end of this song, to the end of this song
To the end of this song, to the end of this song

The curse has won again
Soon I'll be alone
Take all you can

26,Elephant,"Bet he feels like an elephant
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
You know that you're dreaming about being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim
And it's not like Mr. Shock
To get shy when I ask who always is on top?
There must be something deep down in the middle down there
He's not too easily scared
He's got friends but they got the feeling
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh, look, see there he is now coming down the stairs
(Here he comes)
He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (yeah)
'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact

Been anything we could control.
I have just been waiting for the perfect
Time to tell you I don't know.

Little deeper than I should.

It slowly if only we could.

Elodie,
Look at me,
Unless you're trying to hurt me
Heavy blow,
Down I go
Now I just want to let go.

Is it right?
Is it wrong?
I don't know,
It's not the cause I'm fighting for
Anymore
But it sucks to keep on running.

There will be
A time for clearer thinking

Can't get to sleep
I try to hold a good feeling.
I just get one,
Here it comes,
There it goes,

Lose the fight, yeah

In someone else's hands
And if I have done something
And you have to let me go
Think of me as someone
Someone that you know
But if I don't hear something
Pretty soon from now
I'll disconnect completely

An ocean growing inside
All the others seem shallow

So let it happen, let it happen

All this running around

And if I never come back
Tell my mother I'm sorry

I will not vanish and you will not scare me

All the while thinking I might as well do it
They be lovin' someone and I'm not that stupid

36,Past Life,"I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
Which was standard for me
Thursday, 12:30, I got a pretty solid routine these days
I don't know, it just works for me
Anyway, I was leaving I was getting in my car
And I went to adjust the rearview mirror, but in its reflection
Just for a second, I saw a figure, started to trigger
Memories of what I had learned, stopped me in my tracks
Who was that? it was my lover, my lover, from a past life

From a past life (feel like I saw a ghost)
From a past life (so unexpected)
From a past life (I was transfixed)
From a past life

Well, somewhere between a lover and a friend
It was different back then
Surreal, poetic so I'd say, like a bizarre chick flick with a confusing end
But I shut it down, closed it off

A cheap solution to block out a friend, but it was real

So I go about my day as normal
But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
It consumes me
I thought I was moving on but I guess I was just switching off
And now I see my life as the banal slog it instantly became
And I don't know if I can go on the same
But I don't wanna dig up old bones
I mean, I don't even know if she has the same phone number
Who knows? Maybe she does

From a past life
(I guess there's no harm in trying)
From a past life
(What's the worst that could happen?)
For the first time
In a long time

Past life
From a past life (you're not a stranger if you're always on my mind)
For the first time (I know it's late, it just didn't feel right)

55,Retina Show,"It's the retina show for your eye
It's the ego of instinctive desire
It's the reason that you make me break down and cry
It's the retina show for your eye
It's the ego of instinctive desire
It's the reason that you make me break down and cry
If you don't think it, then it won't show
And you believe it too
Baby, tonight, it's written all over you
Baby, tonight, it's written all over you
Make me, make me feel love
Make me, make me feel love
Make me, make me feel love
Make me, make me feel love

56,Sidetracked Soundtrack - Unreleased Demo,"Oh, my darling, why would you come back to me, baby?
I just don't know why
Already know I can't be alone
Don't know what some is
It's time to know, now just have to come and tell me
It could be the summer
It could be the summer
It could be the summer
It could be the summer",Lonerism (20 Year Anniversary Edition / Unreleased Demos)
57,The Boat I Row,"Many ways to go
It's hard to self-assure
When everyone's a pro
Sayin', ""It's so obvious""
But really they don't know (they don't know)
Just like a monster that is (they don't know shit)
Only a shadow (a shadow)
From which you're already runnin'
Easy, I suppose
And even if it takes a hundred
Thousand goes
That way's in front of me 'cause
That's the one I chose (I chose)
That's always staring at you
That's the boat I row (I row)
And though it seems to be
Endless problems, relentless
I know I'm oblivious
Bit overzealous and possibly jealous
I run 'til I'm breathless
Try to suppress it, I couldn't bear it
So onward I go
Many ways to go
It's hard to self-assure
When everyone's a pro
Sayin', ""It's so obvious""
But really they don't know (they don't know)
Just like a monster that is (they don't know shit)
Only a shadow (a shadow)
But you're already runnin'
Endless problems, relentless

Bit overzealous and possibly jealous

58,No Choice,"It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
It wouldn't matter that I had to break it with you
Going over and over brings no joy
It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
And if you're telling me that I've got so much to lose
All the talking about it, it's all noise
Nice and short
There must be something more
Life's a chore
What are we living for?
Let it out
I can see now
Try to hold down
I feel now
All the constants in your future bore you
Kinda makes your mind up for you
Knowing just what lies before you
Gives you no surprise
It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
It wouldn't matter that I had to break it with you
Going over and over brings no joy
Nice and short
There must be something more
Life's a chore
What are we living for?

60,List of People (to Try and Forget About),"Now I gotta add you to my list of people to try and forget about
Now I gotta add yours to my list of faces to try and not think about
Now I gotta tell 'em I don't care and hope that nobody might work it out
It was obviously an illusion 'cause there's never been so much I've been wrong about
And I don't want to spend all my days thinking of the one I can't live without
So I'm gonna have to add you to my list of people to try and forget about
Try and for-
And as the years go by
Your name will fade out gradually
They'll think my heart went dry
But it was waiting in-
So now I gotta add you to my list of people to try and forget about
It could've been magic, nearly had ya
Could you imagine? Nearly had ya
'Til it becomes another one of the things that I just can't talk about
I'm gonna have to keep you on my list of people to try and forget about
Try and for-
And as the years go by
Your name will fade out gradually
They'll think my heart went dry
But it was waiting in the wings
And as the years go by
You're still a banished memory
They'll say my love has died
But it was waiting in the wings",Currents B-Sides & Remixes
61,Taxi's Here,"I was trying to resolve in a way that felt natural
Ooh, I was hoping it would come out right
Who was I kidding?
Push the button and start counting down
Ooh, time is crawling to the moment
Beyond which
I can choose
I can fall
I can lose control
I concur
With the doubt
But I can't
Turn back 'round
And they dread
What's beyond
But time
Is rolling on
Rolling on
Now let's do this right
Everybody (and I'll be trying)
It won't come out right
I can fold
I can lose control
I can lose control
I can face the unknown (ooh)
Yes, I must
Venture there
If I fail (ooh)
I don't care
There's so much
Left unclear
But it's time
Taxi's here",Currents B-Sides & Remixes
62,Beverly Laurel,"Why do they say that they
Know what's right for me?
Hey, I know what's right for me

I know what's right i know what's right
I know what's right for me
I know what's right i know what's right
