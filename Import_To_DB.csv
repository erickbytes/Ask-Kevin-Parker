41,One More Year,"Do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
Our minds were racing and time went slow
If there was trouble in the world we didn't know
If we had a care, it didn't show
But now I worry our horizon's bear nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it, too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did one day on a whim
Has slowly become all we do
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
I know we promised we'd be doing this 'til we die
And now I fear we might
Oh, now I fear we might
But it's okay, I think there's a way
Why don't we just say one more year?
(One more year)
Not worrying if I get the right amount of sleep
(One more year)
Not caring if we do the same thing every week
(One more year)
Of living like I'm only living for me
(One more year)
Of never talking about where we're gonna be
(One more year)
One more year
Of living like the free spirit I wanna be
We got a whole year
(One more year) Fifty-two weeks
Seven days each
(One more year) Four seasons, one reason
One way, one year
(One more year)
One year, one year
From today (From today)
From today (From today)
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
Now one of these is gonna be the last for all time
For all time
One more year

42,Instant Destiny,"I'm about to do something crazy
No more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami
Go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm
This traffic doesn't seem quite as annoying
Quite alright, quite alright, sittin' here
Yes, reminiscent, I think this is different
I know this is different
Let's cause somethin' permanent
Just so we know we can
I'm about to do something crazy
No more delayin'
No destiny is too far
Did you say, ""And here comes forever""
Oh, here forever
Let go of me with open arms
We'll be lovers
Until the end of time
I see it now
I see just how you're so right
It's so clear now
I'm about to do something crazy
No more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami
Go and get married

Of love and devotion

43,Borderline,"Ah
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for somethin'
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday
There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday
(If you and I get comfortable)
We're on the borderline (on the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time (saw the time)
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
If there's room, room for doubt
As within, as without ya
Will I be so in love?
Gettin' closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How could I have known?
How was I to know this life get no shame
I said, ""Come with me outside""
I need to clear my mind
This weight is crushing
Do you see the light, oh
Coming from their eyes, oh no
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline
Gets me every time
These close encounters
Just to know I can (just to know I can)
Once again, I am alone
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation, well I tried (I was fine without ya)
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer, bad idea
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?

Has it been long enough?",The Slow Rush
44,Posthumous Forgiveness,"Ever since I was a small boy
No one else compared to you, no way
I always thought heroes stayed close
Whenever troubled times arose
I didn't know, ain't always how it goes
Every single word you told me
I believed without a question, always
To save all of us
You told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise-up as I grow?
And you could store an ocean in the
Holes in any of the explanations that you gave
And while you still had time, you had a chance
But you decided to take all your sorry's to the grave
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise-up as I grow?
Did you hope I'd never doubt?
Never one day work it out?
You were runnin' for cover
Doin' like any other
Fallen out with a lover
You didn't know that I suffered
What a thing to discover
If there was time to recover
One on one with each other
Just a boy and a father
What I'd give for another
Everything that I have
I wouldn't need us for long
I'd never speak of the time
That you left us alone
Me and Steve, on our own
I wanna tell you about the time
Wanna tell you about my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Learn the words, sing along
Wanna tell you about the time
I was in Abbey Road
Or the time that I had
Mick Jagger on the phone
I thought of you when he spoke
Wanna tell you about that time
Wanna tell you about my life
Wanna play you all my songs
And hear your voice sing along
I wanna say it's alright
You're just a man after all
And I know you had demons
I got some of my own
I think you passed them along
I wanna tell you about the time
Wanna tell you about my life
Wanna play you all my songs
And hear your voice sing along",The Slow Rush
45,Breathe Deeper,"If you think I couldn't hold my own, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If ain't so awful and we're all together, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you think I couldn't roll with you, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If ideally we should feel like this forever, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can

Breathe a little deeper, should you need to come undone
And let those colors run
(It just so) now you're having fun
So do this and get through this, and come find me when you're done
So we can be as one
If you think I couldn't hold my own, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you need someone to tell you that you're special, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you need someone to carry on, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you think no one is feeling what you're feeling, I am

Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper, should you need to come undone
And let those colors run
Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this, and until we see the sun
You're my number one

46,Tomorrow's Dust,"There's no use trying to relate
To that older soul
And no use trying to debate
That they've got it wrong
There's no use pining for love
When you're on your own
And no use crying outside
If nobody's home
There's no use flying to the moon
If they won't believe
So why do I go wrong
On repeat?
I was blinded by a memory
Like it's someone else, like it wasn't me
And there's every chance I'll be learnin' fast
And the day will come, and then it will pass
I taught you wrong
When I say I won't
And though I try, I do the same as though I must
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust
There's no use trying to relate
To that older soul
And no use biding your time
If the bell has tolled
I was blinded by a memory
Like it's someone else, like it wasn't me
And there's every chance I'll be movin' fast
And the day will come, and then it will pass
Sympathy for the fauna
Fragile life in the sauna
In the sea getting warmer
Endlessly 'round the corner
And though I try, I do the same as though I must
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust",The Slow Rush
47,On Track,"I close my front door
And turn on the light
I let out a breath
And hold in a sigh
Ain't nothing new
Ain't that much in sight
And if I'm counting days
Dream fruition ain't
What it's lookin' like.
But strictly speaking I'm still on track
Strictly speaking I'm holding on
More than a minor setback
But strictly speaking I'm still on track
And all of my dreams are still in sight
Cos strictly speaking I've got my whole life
I lost a wheel a while back
But strictly speaking I'm still on track
Challenges falling in my lap
Strung out again but still on track
I know it's unrealistic
Over-optimistic
I know I tried before this
I know it's nearly August
I know I can't ignore this
I'm looking forward to all this
Saying ""babe I just adore this""
And ""babe can we afford this?""
I know it's been a slow year
Nothing much to show here
I didn't really go for it
So not a lot to show for it
The hardest part is over
Adjusting makes it slower
So glad you're coming over
A wall to bring us closer
The world ain't rooting for ya
Nothing to lose it over
We're just a little older
The rest comes easy
But strictly speaking I'm still on track
Strictly speaking I'm holding back
Struggles keep falling in my lap
Yeah, but strictly speaking I'm still on track
So tell everyone I'll be alright
Cos strictly speaking I've got my whole life
More than one major setback
But strictly speaking I'm still on track
The hardest part is over
Adjusting makes it slower
So glad you're coming over
A wall to bring us closer
The world ain't rooting for ya
Nothing to lose it over
We're just a little older
The rest comes easy",The Slow Rush
48,Lost in Yesterday,"When we were living in squalor, wasn't it heaven
Back when we used to get on it four out of seven
Now even though that was a time I hated from day one
Eventually terrible memories turn into great ones
So if they call you, embrace them
If they hold you, erase them
Cause it might've been something, who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might have missed something, don't say
Cause it hurts to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been digging it up like Groundhog Day
Cause it might've been something, don't say
Cause it hurts to be lost in yesterday
Matty said life didn't go the way that he planned it
Said ""oh what I'd give to start over, Boy I'd command it""
So what was I ever afraid of? Why did I worry?
Why was I ever so brainless? Head in a flurry
Cause if they call you, embrace them
If they stall you, erase them
Cause it might have been something, who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might have missed something, don't say
Cause it hurts to get lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been digging it up like Groundhog Day
Cause it might have been something, don't say
Cause it hurts to stay lost in yesterday
If it calls you, embrace it
If it haunts you, face it
I know it's mad, I understand
It's all just snakes and ladders
The myriad, you never had
There's only one that matters
If it calls you, embrace it
If it holds you, erase it",The Slow Rush
49,Is It True,"We were hangin' in the morning
Feelin' all different kinds of things
We were talkin' about everything
From the past to the happenin'
We started talkin' 'bout devotion
The kind that goes on eternally
And I tell her I'm in love with her
But how can I know that I'll always be?
She just said, ""Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now""
It's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I in some kind of mood? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleepin' in my room, here I am, back again
She's in my
I was happy just listening
No intention to be mentioning
We started talkin' 'bout the future
'Bout the notion I was motioning
I'm just so terrified to face up
Like any moment I might wake up
'Cause she's the only thing I think of
I told my mother that I love her
She just said, ""Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now""
It's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I being immature? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again

So I'm gonna have to add you to my list of people to try and forget about
Try and for-
And as the years go by
Your name will fade out gradually
They'll think my heart went dry
But it was waiting in-
So now I gotta add you to my list of people to try and forget about
It could've been magic, nearly had ya
Could you imagine? Nearly had ya
'Til it becomes another one of the things that I just can't talk about
I'm gonna have to keep you on my list of people to try and forget about
Try and for-
And as the years go by
Your name will fade out gradually
They'll think my heart went dry
But it was waiting in the wings
And as the years go by
You're still a banished memory
They'll say my love has died
But it was waiting in the wings",Currents B-Sides & Remixes
61,Taxi's Here,"I was trying to resolve in a way that felt natural
Ooh, I was hoping it would come out right
Who was I kidding?
Push the button and start counting down
Ooh, time is crawling to the moment
Beyond which
I can choose
I can fall
I can lose control
I concur
With the doubt
But I can't
Turn back 'round
And they dread
What's beyond
But time
Is rolling on
Rolling on
Now let's do this right
Everybody (and I'll be trying)
It won't come out right
I can fold
I can lose control
I can lose control
I can face the unknown (ooh)
Yes, I must
Venture there
If I fail (ooh)
I don't care
There's so much
Left unclear
But it's time
Taxi's here",Currents B-Sides & Remixes
62,Beverly Laurel,"Why do they say that they
Know what's right for me?
Hey, I know what's right for me
Why do they say that they
Know what's right for me?
Hey, I know what's right for me
I know what's right i know what's right
I know what's right for me
I know what's right i know what's right
I know what's right for me
I know what's right for me
I know what's right for me
I know what's right for me
I know what's right for me",Lonerism B-Sides & Remixes
